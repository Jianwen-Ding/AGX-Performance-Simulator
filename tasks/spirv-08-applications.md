# Task SPIR-V 8: applications (ray tracer, neural-network inference, edge detection)

**Workloads:** `raytrace`, `mlp`, `sobel`. These are recorded and verified by `make asahi-verify` with the others;
they are **PENDING** until then. The detailed procedure is in `tasks/spirv-workloads.md`.

## Why these

The other workloads test instructions and algorithms. These three are small but complete applications: the kind of
thing someone would actually run on the GPU. Each produces a result a person can check by eye, as well as by the
reference.

| Workload | What it computes | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `raytrace` | Three spheres on a checkered ground plane, a directional light with hard shadows, Lambert shading, one mirror bounce (the blue sphere and the floor reflect) | RGBA8 image: `image0.ppm` from `run`, `sim_image0.ppm` from `sim` |
| `mlp` | A 128 → 256 (ReLU) → 16 (softmax) perceptron over a batch, one workgroup per input | Class probabilities; the check also requires the same predicted class as float64 |
| `sobel` | Sobel gradient magnitude, min(\|gx\| + \|gy\|, 255), on an 8-bit 4K image | 8-bit image, `image1.pgm`; integer-exact |

## Offline sanity checks (not hardware verification)

- **lavapipe:** all three pass at both sizes.
- **Shim-compiled Mesa 25.2.8 and 26.0.3 code on the functional simulator:** 6 of 6.
- **Cost model:** predictions for the large sizes.
- **`raytrace`:** checked against an independent float64 numpy version of the same scene. Pixels on silhouettes and
  shadow edges may flip between float implementations. The check allows 1% of pixels to differ by more than 2 levels:
  lavapipe is at 0.09% at 1920×1080, and the simulator at 0.4% at 96×64. The far ground is a uniform grey on purpose:
  a distant checkerboard aliases, and any rounding difference flips its squares.

## On the M2

1. After `make asahi-verify`, look at the images: the GPU's render and the simulator's render of the recorded code
   should be indistinguishable. Convert them to PNG with any image tool.
2. `sobel` must be word-for-word identical (PASS).
3. `raytrace` and `mlp` use sqrt / exp / rcp, so expect CLOSE. Record the number of differing pixels and their
   largest difference.
4. Compare the large-size times with `predict`, and report frames per second for the 1080p ray tracer, and inferences
   per second for `mlp`.
